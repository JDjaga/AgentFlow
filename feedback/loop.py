"""
Feedback Loop
-------------
Phase 3 addition: Queries the database for previously REJECTED outreach
messages and their rejection reasons, then passes them to the Writer agent
as learning context so future drafts improve over time.

How it works:
  1. Before each pipeline run, query outreach table for rejected messages
  2. Group rejection reasons by type (PII / Injection / Hallucination / Tone)
  3. Format as a concise learning summary
  4. Inject into the Writer's backstory via build_writer(feedback_context=...)

This closes the loop: the system learns from its own mistakes.
