"""
Security Guard
--------------
The main entry point for Phase 2's security layer.

Intercepts every outreach message from the Writer and runs it through
the full security pipeline:
  1. PII Check        — strips/flags personal identifiers
  2. Injection Check  — blocks prompt hijacking attempts
  3. Hallucination    — cross-references facts against Scout data
  4. Tone Check       — ensures professional, non-spammy language

Each message gets a Security Score (0–100).
Messages scoring >= 70 are APPROVED and saved to the database.
Messages scoring <  70 are REJECTED with a detailed reason logged.

NeMo Guardrails Integration:
  The guardrails/ folder contains the Colang config that wraps this
  logic in NVIDIA's NeMo Guardrails framework for enterprise-grade
  auditability (used in Phase 3 for the dashboard security log).
